# Purpose of the Report

The purpose of this report is to study and apply the **Minimax algorithm** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to a simple game, specifically the game **Connect 4**, implemented in Python. 

## Objectives
- Create a single-player **Connect 4 game** with a perfect AI.
- Explore the relationship between the algorithm's **lookahead depth** and its performance:
  - **Higher lookahead depth**: Increases the AI's success rate.
  - **Trade-off**: Longer execution time as the depth increases.
